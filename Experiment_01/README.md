# Background Study

Digital logic circuits form the backbone of computer architecture and are used to perform logical operations on binary inputs. Basic components such as AND, OR, and NOT gates are combined to form more complex circuits like multiplexers and encoders.

A Multiplexer (MUX) is a combinational circuit that selects one input from multiple inputs based on select lines and forwards it to the output. A priority encoder is used to encode multiple inputs into a binary format while giving priority to the highest-order input.

Logisim Evolution is a digital circuit simulation tool that allows users to design, test, and analyze digital circuits visually. It provides a user-friendly interface where components can be connected and their behavior can be observed in real-time.

# Experiment Description

In this experiment, various digital circuits were designed and simulated using Logisim Evolution.

## 1. 8:1 Multiplexer

An 8:1 multiplexer was implemented to select one input among eight inputs using select lines.

### Components Used
- Input Pins
- Multiplexer
- Select Lines
- Output Pin

### Working
The select lines determine which input is connected to the output. By changing the select line values, different inputs were observed at the output.

## 2. Hierarchical Multiplexer Design

A hierarchical multiplexer design was created to efficiently handle multiple input lines using smaller multiplexers combined together.

### Components Used
- Multiple 2:1 or 4:1 Multiplexers
- Input Pins
- Select Lines
- Output Pin

### Working
Smaller multiplexers were interconnected to create a larger multiplexer structure. This demonstrated modular circuit design.

An 8:3 priority encoder circuit was designed to convert multiple input signals into a binary coded output while giving priority to the highest-order input.

### Components Used
- Input Pins
- OR Gates
